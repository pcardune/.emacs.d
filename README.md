# pcardune's emacs config

So I always forget what is in my emacs config. Here is some documentation of things to look at

* [better-defaults](https://github.com/technomancy/better-defaults) - some
  helpful defaults to get you started.
* [projectile](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile) - a mode for navigating in
  a "project" i.e. git repository
* [project-explorer](https://github.com/sabof/project-explorer) - mode for
  displaying a directory tree for your project in one panel
* [magit](http://magit.vc/manual/magit/#Top) - mode for working with git

Some sources of inspiration:

* [awesome-emacs](https://github.com/emacs-tw/awesome-emacs) - list of good
  packages/libraries

Some things I will probably forget about that are fun to use!

* `M-x browse-url` - open the url under the cursor in a browser!
