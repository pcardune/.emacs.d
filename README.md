# pcardune's emacs config

So I always forget what is in my emacs config. Here is some documentation of things to look at

* [projectile](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile) - a mode for navigating in a "project" i.e. git repository
* [project-explorer](https://github.com/sabof/project-explorer) - mode for displaying a directory tree for your project in one panel
* [magit](http://magit.vc/manual/magit/#Top) - mode for working with git
